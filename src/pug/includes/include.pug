The main goals of this code sprint are to support the development of OGC (draft) Standards, as well as software which implements those Standards. In addition, it also aims to create awareness about the Standards and software projects. This code sprint takes place at the VONK innovation center (Rotterdam, the Netherlands), and on the OGC-events Discord server. It is hosted by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and Geonovum.";
