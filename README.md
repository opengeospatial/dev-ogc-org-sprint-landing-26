# README

This repository hosts the source code of the Code Sprint #26 Website: https://developer.ogc.org/sprints/26

The website is served from [GitHub actions](https://github.com/opengeospatial/dev-ogc-org-sprint-landing-26/actions). Read [this note](#note-about-publishing-the-website), to understand how the website is generated. 

## Quick Start :rocket:

Clone this repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/opengeospatial/dev-ogc-org-sprint-landing-26.git`

Then enter the folder:

`cd dev-ogc-org-sprint-landing-26`

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Start development server:

`npm start`

Once you start the development server, the site will be available at:

`http://localhost:3000`

The hot reload will ensure that the changes you do on the code will be reflected on the browser.

### Note about Publishing the Website

Commit all your changes to the `master` branch. The static build will be generated each time from these [GitHub actions](https://github.com/opengeospatial/dev-ogc-org-sprint-landing-26/actions). In a nutshell, **you don't need to do anything to publish the website** - the republish will be triggered automatically with each push to `master`.
